### Introduction

Css stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used to style and layout web pages It describes how Html elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media Css allows developers and designers to define how elements are positioned in the browser and how a webpage should look, including colors, fonts, spacing, and much more Css comprises style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then applied to the corresponding elements in your document A style rule set consists of a selector and declaration block The selector points to the HTML element you want to style, while the declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons Each declaration includes CSS properties and their corresponding values.

## Important information and frequently asked questions

Currently the course is in process. The basic, intermediate and backend blocks have been started, and that was the initial goal of the project. And then I don't rule out adding new lessons in the future, but I think that for now it can serve as a basis for anyone who wants to start learning this language.

* As soon as the course continues I will update the repository and notify the networks.
Thank you very much for all the support shown!
